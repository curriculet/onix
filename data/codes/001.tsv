01	Early notification	Use for a complete record issued earlier than approximately six months before publication.
02	Advance notification (confirmed)	Use for a complete record issued to confirm advance information approximately six months before publication; or for a complete record issued after that date and before information has been confirmed from the book-in-hand.
03	Notification confirmed from book-in-hand	Use for a complete record issued to confirm advance information using the book-in-hand at or just before actual publication date; or for a complete record issued at any later date.
04	Update (partial)	Intended to be used for an update to a part of the record which is sent without re-issuing the complete record. In practise, however, ONIX updating is invariably by complete record replacement using code 03, and code 04 is not used.
05	Delete	Use when sending an instruction to delete a record which was previously issued. Note that a delete instruction should NOT be used when a product is cancelled, put out of print, or otherwise withdrawn from sale: this should be handled as a change of availability status, leaving the receiver to decide whether to retain or delete the record. A delete instruction is only used when there is a particular reason to withdraw a record completely, eg because it was issued in error.
08	Notice of sale	Notice of sale of a product, from one publisher to another: sent by the publisher disposing of the product
09	Notice of acquisition	Notice of acquisition of a product, by one publisher from another: sent by the acquiring publisher
